		  <p> Volleyball Rules
				The basic rules of volleyball are simple. Players must use their hands and arms to hit the ball over the net and into the opponent's court. The ball must not touch the ground on the opponent's side of the net. A point is scored when the ball lands in the opponent's court, or when the opponent makes a mistake.
				Volleyball is played in sets. The first team to win 25 points by a two-point margin wins the set. The match is played to the best of five sets.

				There are a number of different volleyball techniques, including:

				Serving: The act of putting the ball into play. The ball must be hit over the net and into the opponent's court.
				Passing: The act of receiving the ball from the opponent and controlling it so that it can be set up for an attack.
				Setting: The act of sending the ball to a teammate in a position to spike it.
				Spiking: The act of hitting the ball over the net with force.
				Blocking: The act of jumping up at the net to block the opponent's attack.
