		No matter what your reasons are, being committed to fitness and health is a positive choice. It is something that can benefit you in many ways, both physically and mentally.
		Our advice, Set realistic goals. Don't try to do too much too soon, or you're more likely to get discouraged and give up. Start with small, achievable goals, and gradually build up your fitness level over time.
		Find an activity you enjoy. If you don't enjoy the activity you're doing, you're less likely to stick with it. Find an activity that you find fun and challenging, and that fits into your lifestyle.
		Make fitness a part of your routine. Schedule regular time for exercise, and treat it like any other important appointment. Don't let other things get in the way of your workout.
		Find a workout buddy. Having someone to exercise with can help you stay motivated and accountable.
		Reward yourself for your successes. When you reach a fitness goal, reward yourself with something you enjoy. This will help you stay on track and motivated.
